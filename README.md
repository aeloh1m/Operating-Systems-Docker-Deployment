## General Information
-  An insight: <br />
    - For the present project, the requirements were to create a Docker image containing an index.html with a message, to furthermore upload it to dockerhub.com and display it using kubernetes and nginx.

- How did we proceeded? <br />
    - First of all, we've had to create a **k8s cluster** and a **docker image** with the tag "v1" containing an index.html with an H1 message, and inside the previous cluster, we made a **namespace** called "grupo1" where we deployed the previous Docker image, having 3 replica sets.

- What is the purpose of this project? <br />
    - The purpose of this project is to show the process and files needed for such procedure, and to show what we achieved to our professors.
